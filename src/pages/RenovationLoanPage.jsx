          <h2>What is a renovation/equity loan?</h2>
          <p>
            A renovation loan combines the purchase price (or existing mortgage balance) with funds for repairs and
            upgrades. You finance everything in one mortgage, with the future improved value considered in the approval.
            Perfect for fixer-uppers, aging homes that need updates, or projects that add energy efficiency.
